- ### **Methodology**
  In the field of data analytics/data science a analyst need to  follow some steps like probelm statements,data extraction,data transfromations and data loading we called the process ETL(Extract transform load) and also Descriptive analytics.so in this project we have followed these setps in power bi.I have provided a file of Udemy_da_powerbi.pdf that contain all streps in pictures to picture that we have used in this analysis project.in the down below the basic method we have followed in each step-
  
  #### 1. Problem Definition
